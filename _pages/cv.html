</div>
<p><strong>Technology Innovation Institute (TII) | Haifa Israel<br />2024 - todate | Chief Researcher</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Leading AI/IR organization for TII in Israel.&nbsp; The AI/IR focuses on advancing the state of the art in AI and Information Retrieval to improve TII&rsquo;s series of Falcon Large Language Models.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Alexa Shopping, Amazon | Haifa, Israel<br />2017 - 2023 | VP of Research</strong><strong><br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><u>Established the worldwide (US, UK, Israel) applied science organization of Alexa Shopping</u>. Alexa Shopping focuses on enabling new customers&rsquo; shopping experiences and addressing existing customers&rsquo; pain points when interacting with Alexa, Amazon voice-based digital assistant. The applied science organization I built from scratch drove the science behind numerous&nbsp; new shopping-experiences for Alexa customers, and validated the novelty of their work by publishing at conferences such as WSDM, TheWebConf, SIGIR, ACL, ICML, etc.</li>
<li><u>Cofounder and member of the Amazon Science Leadership team</u>. Helped establish the cross-org Amazon Science Leadership team responsible for defining shared mechanisms for all scientists across all of Amazon (e.g. the scientific publication approval, the scientist job definitions, the Amazon Science external website, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Yahoo Inc. | Haifa, Israel<br />2014-2017 | VP of Research, </strong>head of Yahoo Research worldwide (2016-2017), of Yahoo Labs EMEA (2015-2016) of Yahoo Labs Israel &amp; India (2014) <br /><strong>2009-2013 | Senior Research Director</strong>, head of Yahoo Labs Israel (2013), head of Yahoo Research Israel (2009-2012)</p>
<ul>
<li>As a manager, I was first tasked with building from scratch a new research team, which would live side by side with the existing Applied Sciences team in Haifa. As of 2013, I was appointed head of Yahoo Labs Israel and overall lead of the Haifa site. In early 2016, we decided to adopt a new hybrid model of research at Yahoo, which combined independent and integrated research. I then became the head of Yahoo Research worldwide, and served as chair of the Yahoo Research Council. I directly managed research teams in Haifa and NY. Our researchers contributed to key products of the company in Ads, Mail and Search.</li>
<li>As a research lead, I provided strategic guidance to my teams, ensuring they investigate research directions that are relevant and meaningful to Yahoo, publishing at top conferences and contributing to the Academic community. We published dozens of research papers and earned several best paper/runner ups awards at KDD&rsquo;2009, ODA&rsquo;2011, RecSys&rsquo;2011, KDD&rsquo;2013, ICWSM&rsquo;2015, SIGIR&rsquo;2016. In addition, I personally contributed to the research community by giving tutorials and regularly serving as Senior PC member or PC chair at conferences such as SIGIR, WSDM and WWW.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Google Inc. | Haifa, Israel<br /></strong><strong>2006-2009 | Director of Engineering</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I joined Google in 2006 as its first engineer in Israel and was tasked with opening the Haifa Engineering Center. I established a strategy for the center and developed a core competency around Search Quality, YouTube and Gmail. Our most impactful was the launch of Google Suggest (also known as &ldquo;query auto completion&rdquo;) on google.com in 2008, and subsequently on all international Google search and YouTube homepages. Another visible launch initiated by my team was YouTube &ldquo;Video Annotations, and the email recipient completion feature in Gmail.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IBM Haifa Research Lab | Haifa, Israel<br />2005-2006 | Department Group Manager and Distinguished Engineer<br />1993-2003 | Senior Manager</strong> (2001-2005), Manager (1997-2001), Research Staff Member (1993-1997)</p>
<ul>
<li>On the technical side, I introduced in the Lab the field of search. I led the&nbsp; first Web application project to the Lab, devising with colleagues a new Web crawling and site mapping software to visualize and manage web sites. I headed the research and development of the first IBM Web search engine, which led to several research publications, and won the &ldquo;ad-hoc track&rdquo; of the TREC conference in 2001. I was elected to the IBM Academy of Technology in 2001, and appointed Distinguished Engineer in 2006.</li>
<li>On the management side, my responsibility consisted in securing internal funding to support and grow the group. In 2002, I took over the additional role, beyond the Haifa site, to co-lead the &ldquo;Unstructured Information Management&rdquo; sub-strategy for the IBM Research Division. In 2004, I was appointed a member of the Lab management team. I led teams conducting applied research in multiple information related areas, from search and collaboration to voice and multimedia technologies.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>IBM T.J. Watson Research Center | Hawthorne, New York, USA 1989-1993<br />1989-1993 | Research Staff Member </strong>(1990-1992) Post Doc (1989-1990)</p>
<ul>
<li>I joined the software environment group as a post-doc, upon graduating in 1989, and investigated the applicability of information retrieval technologies to indexing comments in software development environments.&nbsp; Upon completion of my post-doc, I was offered a conversion to a research staff position, which allowed me to extend my research agenda. I decided then to depart from the field of software and fully focus on information retrieval. I built in C/Unix, Guru, the first IBM Research information retrieval engine, which leveraged the novel indexing mechanism I had devised during my PhD studies. Guru led to several research publications at top venues (SIGIR&rsquo;89, TSE) and was the ancestor of Juru that my team later developed at IBM Haifa.</li>

</div>
<p><strong>Technion, Israel Institute of Technology | Haifa, Israel<br /></strong><strong>1985-1989 | PhD in Computer Science</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My PhD research focused on the application of information retrieval technologies to the construction of software reuse libraries. The key contribution of my thesis was the invention of a novel multiple-word indexing unit (lexical affinities) that allowed disambiguating words by context and achieved higher precision than traditional single-word models that were the standard at the time. My advisor was Prof. Daniel M. Berry, yet I tightly collaborated with Prof. Gail Kaiser, who hosted me at Columbia University CS Department, in 1986-87 and introduced me to the field of information retrieval.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sorbonne University (formerly Paris VI) | Paris France<br /></strong><strong>1984-1985 | D.E.A (Graduate Degree) in Computer Science/AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In parallel to my engineering degree, I was admitted into a selective Graduate Program at Paris VI University in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science. I graduated with honors (&ldquo;Mention Bien&rdquo;).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussees (ENPC) | Paris, France</strong><br /><strong>1982-1985 | Ingenieur Civil des Ponts et Chaussees (Engineering Degree) &ndash; </strong>Major Applied Math and CS</p>
<ul>
<li>After two years of &ldquo;Math Sup&rdquo; and &ldquo;Math Spe&rdquo; classes, I passed the competitive exam to the &ldquo;Concours Commun&rdquo; for admission in one of the top French Engineering Schools. I was ranked among the top 1% candidates and admitted to the Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussees. I selected a double major, Applied Math and Computer Science. I graduated with honors.</li>
