I am serving today as the Chief Researcher of the  AI/IR organization at the Technology Innovation Institute (TII). TII is the UAE-based institute that invented Falcon, one of the leading open-source Large Language Models around. We are working with a select team of talented scientists on some of the most interesting challenges in Search and AI. I could not wish for a more exciting and meaningful adventure.


## Recent news:
* We just finished running the [SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG Challenge](https://liverag.tii.ae) and results will soon be out!
* With my colleague at TII, Dr Hakim Hacid, we are chairing the Web Conference'2026 that will take place in Dubai next year.
