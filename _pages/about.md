I am serving today as the Chief Researcher of the  AI/IR organization at the Technology Innovation Institute (TII). TII is the UAE-based institute that invented Falcon, one of the leading open-source Large Language Models around. We are working with a select team of talented scientists on some of the most interesting challenges in Search and AI. I could not wish for a more exciting and meaningful adventure.
